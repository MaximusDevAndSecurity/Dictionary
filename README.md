# Dictionary App

This is a simple dictionary app built with React and Vite.

## Getting Started

**1. Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

**2. Installation:**
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MaximusDevAndSecurity/Dictionary.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd dictionary-app`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`

**3. Running the App:**
- For development, run: `npm run dev`. Once the server starts, it will provide you with a local address (typically something like `http://localhost:[PORT]`). Open this address in your browser.
- For a production build, run: `npm run build` which will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory.
- To serve the production build, you can use the `serve` package. Install it globally with `npm install -g serve` and then serve the app with `serve dist`. This will also provide a local address you can open in your browser.
